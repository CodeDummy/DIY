#Abstract 

Develop a board support package (BSP) for the Zedboard.
Features

	• Every major peripheral must be accessible with the BSP
	• PC - Board communication can be through USB/UART in the beginning and later through ethernet.
	• PC app should be able to communicate with all the peripherals on the Zedboard.
	• Communication interface must be designed and standardized to incorporate future application projects on the zedboard.
    
	
	

Pre-work

Set up VIVADO, VS-Code (with Live share) , Anaconda (python) , Git
Set up a Github Repo(All docs regarding the project must be stored here)

Go through tutorials for Vivado/Zynq




Task 1

Develop a communication interface from the PC to the board. This can be USB/Serial port in the beginning. Later we need an ethernet interface (some kind of client server). I want the PC side to be Python based. On the zedboard we can have a c based app running. 

Subtask

	1. Design the protocol and frame structure. How to address each peripheral.The interface USB or UART or ethernet should be abstracted away from the user.
